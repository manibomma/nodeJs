* NodeJs is Asynchronous

* Callback Pattern : block of instructions wrapped in a function to be called when an asynchronous call has completed

* Functions return values by 2 types :
    1. direct style i.e., using 'return' statement
    2. CPS - continuation passing style, here there is no need to use a return statement

* process.nextTick() - this tells nodeJs to invole the function that we send to nextTick() on the next loop
